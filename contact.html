                <h3>Understanding Delivery Timeframes</h3>
                <p>To estimate when your order will arrive, please consider these guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Shipping:</strong> Orders typically take 5-7 business days to arrive after
                        processing</li>
                    <li><strong>Expedited Shipping:</strong> Orders typically take 2-3 business days to arrive after
                        processing</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Day Delivery:</strong> Orders placed before 2 PM will arrive the next business
                        day</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember to add 1-2 business days for order processing time to all estimates.</p>
                <p>For precise delivery estimates, please check the shipping time calculator during checkout, which
                    provides personalized timeframes based on your location and current inventory status.</p>
